    "text": "üçî What is the Big Mac Index?\nDeveloped in the 80s by a British newspaper The Economist (WealthDesk 2022), the Big Mac Index compares the price of Big Mac burgers across the globe as an indicator of whether an exchange rate is overvalued or undervalued compared to a base currency as the reference point. This is built on the idea that, in the long run, an identical basket of goods should cost the same in every part of the world, with the only difference being the exchange rate - any imbalances would then suggest that the current exchange rate is not at the correct level.\nSince the Big Macs around the world are being made with nigh-identical ingredients, labor efforts, and equipment. This item is then used a proxy for the identical basket of goods between countries; and therefore is used for the price comparison.\n\n\n\nDeconstruction of a Big Mac.

    "text": "üí≠ How does it work?\nThe general understanding is that if the difference between the cost of a Big Mac in Country A is not the same as its price in Country B, then the currency rate is unbalanced.\nFor instance, suppose that the Big Mac costs $5 in the United States and it costs ¬£5 in the United Kingdom, the Big Mac Index would suggest the exchange rate to be 1 USD = 1 GBP; however, the current market rate (according to Google, 5 September 2023) is 1 USD = 0.79 GBP. This indicates that the US dollar is undervalued and/or the British pound is overvalued by 21%.\nTheoretically, this enables an arbitrage strategy as a British person could just exchange for the dollar buy the Big Mac in the US as it would only cost them 3.95 GBP, netting a profit of 1.05 pound when reselling it in the UK. This would continue on until the exchange rate adjusts to the correct level suggested by the Big Mac Index as such trades will no longer yield any benefits.\n\n\n\nHow does the Big Mac Index work.

    "text": "üîç The Hypothesis\nThe purpose of this analysis is to examine the question:\n‚ÄúDo all exchange rates eventually converge to the Big Mac Index levels?‚Äù\nWe will try to observe this effect by using multiple currencies as the base currency then plot the valuations of many other currencies against them. For this purpose, we will stack multiple time series line for each country against a baseline. If the overall trends narrow as time progresses, which indicates signs of convergence to the Big Mac Index parity."

    "text": "üìà Trends of currency valuations seen from different base currencies.\n\nUSD - US Dollar\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: USD as the base currency\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1 depicts the changes in world currency valuations against the US dollar, in which we can observe that most nations are undervalued against the USD. Pre-2015 saw many wildly overvalued currency such as the Norwegian Krone and Swiss Franc. Nonetheless, there seem to be converging trend as the overvaluation/undervaluation gap becomes narrower in the two decades time period.\n\n\nEUR - Euro\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: EUR as the base currency\n\n\n\nSimilar to the US dollar, the Euro is also mostly seen as an overvalued currency for other countries. There is a slight hint of convergence toward the baseline in Figure¬†2, albeit much harder to see compared to Figure¬†1.\n\n\nGBP - British pound\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: GBP as the base currency\n\n\n\nSimilar to both the USD and the EUR, British pound is another highly overvalued currency in the international stage (Figure¬†3). Perhaps because the UK was in the Eurozone that they both display a similar valuation trend as compared to the USD‚Äôs valuation which was on a much wider disparity.\n\n\nJPY - Japanese yen\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Yen as the base currency\n\n\n\nOnto our first nation in Asia, in Figure¬†4, the years before 2015 saw large disparities in currency exchange rates against the Japanese Yen - similar to what we in the US. It is known that most Western countries have higher standard of livings compared to Asia‚Äôs; therefore, Japan‚Äôs Big Mac price positioned in the middle area where there are similar amount of currency that overvalued the Yen compared to those who undervalued against it.\n\n\nCNY - Chinese yuan\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: GBP as the base currency\n\n\n\nChina is known as the factory of the world thanks to its competitive labor costs and exchange rate practices (The Economist 2021). As China trying to position its exchange rate to be cheaper to make their exports attractive, this is reflected in their Big Mac Index position in Figure¬†5 with the baseline drawn in the lower area compared to all aforementioned currencies. While there are still countries that the Chinese yuan is overvalued against, a Big Mac in China is still amongst the cheapest and undervalued when seen from the perspective of western countries. The convergence of exchange is also clearest here compared to other base currencies."
